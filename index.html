                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                    with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                    venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                    created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
                    A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with
                    a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
                    of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                    and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                    Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

                    In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                    reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                    Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                    Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                    permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as
                    the surface of the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for
                    Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
                    the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
